In her music, she re-questions and examines accustomed phenomena in the process of music making, exposes them to concepts of every day life (habits of the society, modern trends, pop culture, science, etc.) then resets them in compositions that often include audience action in the performance. Bosnić is drawn to impossible missions, absurd solutions, limited material, playfulness, uncertain outcomes, audience participation, treating instruments as ready-made objects of expression and treating real life objects as music instruments. She obtained a PhD degree in music composition at Goldsmiths, University of London (UK), supervised by prof. Roger Redgate. She writes pieces for solo, chamber, ensemble and orchestra performances, as well as, projects for electronics, multi-media and interactive settings with audience participation. Bosnić’s works have been performed in festivals, such as: Impuls (Austria), CTM Festival, The International Summer Courses for New Music in Darmstadt, The Festival of Young Artists Bayreuth (Germany), Music Here and Now, International Review of Composers, April Meetings, KOMA – Compositions of Young Authors (Serbia), International Youth Arts Festival in Kingston upon Thames (United Kingdom), Sites + Subjects in Plovdiv (Bulgaria) and Timsonia 2018 New Music Festival in Timisoara (Romania).
