PHONES:ON is an interactive concert of new music and sound installations that all allow or specifically require different ways of using smartphones in the performance. Thus, smartphones serve as a source of sound, display scores, send and receive instructions, conduct, play music, illuminate the performerâ€™s faces, take photos, play videos and use various applications. Audience also takes part in some of the works, using their phones and following instructions shown on stage. The show was premiered in the hall of Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra in Belgrade on 27th June 2019, and now it is ready to travel to other exciting festivals of new music, new media, performance and sound art.
