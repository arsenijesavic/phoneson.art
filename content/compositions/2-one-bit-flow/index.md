          The program rhythmically repeats arpeggiated C power chord with C
          tuned to 132Hz. When you feel that the time is right, change it to the
          power chord a fifth upward, using the buttons below or the swipe
          panel. Again, when the time is right, move again forward. Travel
          forward in a similar way by fifths ever further as long as it feels
          right. After that, change the chord distance itself for fifth upward.
          The new interval will now be a major second (we translate all
          intervals to those with smallest distance, for instance, a major ninth
          upwards becomes a major second also upwards, while a minor sixth
          upwards translates into a major third downwards). Change direction
          from time to time and move backwards instead of forwards. Traverse the
          chords reachable in this way by going forward or backward by the same
          interval, as before. After that, change the interval again for a fifth
          upward, which now makes a major third downward. Do the same as before.
          The composition ends when you have used with all or most of the
          intervals.

          With every chord change the manner of arpeggio changes. The program
          goes through all the 4-permutations of 9 notes of a power chord
          distributed in three octaves. There are 3024 of them (9*8*7*6). There
          are 16 notes in each arpeggio phrase and four new permutations are
          selected on each chord change.

          Start and stop the music with Play/Pause button below. Perform the
          piece using the the four buttons next to it or the swipe panel below.
          Interval buttons have an immediate effect, while Chord buttons change
          notes of the chord as they appear. Swipes in four direction are also
          available on the above swipe surface, with the same meaning as the
          respective four buttons. Each button triggers one of the following
          events.
