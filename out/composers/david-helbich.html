His trajectory moves between representative and interactive works, pieces and interventions, between conceptual work and actions. His concepts are often presented in print, such as photo and illustrated score books as well as in live performances, sound interventions, audio guides and on social media. Many of his works address concrete physical and social experiences. A recurrent interest is the direct work with a self-performing audience. In the last 15 years, his work has been shown all over Europe, and recently presented a.o. at Martin-Gropius-Bau (Berlin), Palais de Tokyo (Paris), Oude Kerk (Amsterdam), Queens Museum and UnionDocs (New York) and Caf√© OTO (London). Helbich received the First Prize for the composition award ‚Äòad libitum‚Äô (Stuttgart) for his piano book ‚ÄúFur aufrichtiges Klavier‚Äù (2011). He is the author of the bestselling photo books ‚ÄúBelgian solutions‚Äù ‚Äì volume 1 and volume 2 (Luster, Antwerp). Both have recently being added to the national photo book heritage collection, catalogue and exhibition ‚ÄúPhotobook Belge‚Äù (FOMU-Antwerp).In 2016, Helbich was granted a three-years scholarship for artistic development and research by the Flemish community. Helbich also teaches at music and dance academies in Europe and collaborates with choreographers such as Mette Edvardsen (NO/BE) and Heike Langsdorf (DE/BE). Helbich has been living and working in Brussels since 2002. He studied composition in Amsterdam and Freiburg.</p></div><div class="sm:flex justify-between items-center mt-10"><h3 class="w-full sm:w-6/12 text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold">Location</h3><div class="w-full sm:w-6/12 text-xl"><p class="text-base sm:text-xl">üìç <!-- -->Germany</p></div></div><div class="sm:flex justify-between items-center mt-10"><h3 class="w-full smw-6/12 text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold">Connect</h3><div class="w-full smw-6/12 text-base sm:text-xl"><a href="http://davidhelbich.blogspot.com/" class="text-indigo-500">üîó <!-- -->http://davidhelbich.blogspot.com/</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/arsenijesavic/Desktop/phoneson.art/content/composers/david-helbich.md","_type":"composers","slug":"/composers/david-helbich","name":"David Helbich","photo":"/images/david-helbich.jpg","country":"Germany","website":"http://davidhelbich.blogspot.com/","biography":"David Helbich (1973, Germany) is a sound-, installation- and performance artist, as well as a photographer and teacher, who creates various experimental conceptual works for the stage, paper and online media and in pubic space.
